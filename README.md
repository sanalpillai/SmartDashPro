## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly
- SciPy (optional, for advanced statistical analysis)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanalpillai/SmartDashPro.git
   cd SmartDashPro
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the dashboard:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit-auto-dashboard.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the Dashboard

1. Upload your CSV or Excel file using the file uploader
2. Alternatively, select one of the built-in sample datasets
3. Navigate between different tabs to explore your data:
   - **Dashboard**: Overview of key metrics and visualizations
   - **Insights**: Deeper analysis and relationships
   - **Data Explorer**: Explore individual columns
   - **Data Quality**: Assess data completeness and issues

## üí° How It Works

SmartDashPro analyzes your data using these intelligent processes:

1. **Data Loading & Initial Analysis**
   - Detects file type and loads data
   - Analyzes basic statistics like row count, column types, and completeness

2. **Column Analysis**
   - Examines each column to determine data type, semantics, and cardinality
   - Analyzes column names to infer meaning (e.g., identifying gender, location, etc.)
   - Determines the most appropriate visualization type for each column

3. **Insight Generation**
   - Identifies correlations between numeric columns
   - Detects categorical relationships and creates cross-tabulations
   - Examines time-based patterns if date columns are present

4. **Visualization Creation**
   - Builds appropriately styled charts for each column based on its characteristics
   - Creates combinations of columns for relationship analysis
   - Generates summary metrics and key insights

5. **Quality Assessment**
   - Calculates data quality metrics like completeness and consistency
   - Identifies outliers, missing values, and duplicates
   - Provides a quality score with detailed component analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can modify the dashboard's appearance and behavior by:

- Editing the custom CSS in the `st.markdown()` section at the top of the script
- Adjusting the visualization parameters in the `create_enhanced_visualization()` function
- Adding new sample datasets in the main app logic

## üìö Use Cases

- **Data Exploration**: Quickly understand new datasets without manual analysis
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Identify issues in your data before deeper analysis
- **Business Intelligence**: Generate shareable dashboards from business data
- **Research Visualization**: Create publication-ready charts for research data
- **Educational Tool**: Help students understand data visualization principles
